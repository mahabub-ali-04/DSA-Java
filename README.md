# Added String Folder


To check String is palindrome or not?

given a route containing four directions(E,W,N,S) find the shortestpath to reach destination.

for a given set of Strings print the largest String
"apple" , "mango", "banana".

for a given String convert each the first letter of each word to uppercase.

 String Compression - "aaabbcccdd"-> "a3b2c3d2".

# Added Arrays Folder

performing linear Search.

Performing binary search.

finding largest and smallest elements in array.

reversing array.

pairs in arrays.

print subarrays.

# BitManupulation

check if a number is even or odd?

get ith bit of a numbber (e.g. n= 10 , i =2 )

set ith bit of a number(e.g. n =10 , i = 2)

clear ith bit of a number(e.g. n = 10 , i = 3)

update ith bit of a number(e.g. n =10 , i = 2 , newBit = 1)

clear last ith bit of a number(e.g. n =10 , i = 2)

clear range of bits of a number(e.g. n =10 , i = 2 , j = 4)

check if a number is power of 2 or not?

count set bits in a number(means how many times 1 is occured)
